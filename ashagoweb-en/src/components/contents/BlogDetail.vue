              <p>
                Generally
                <a href="https://www.baidu.com">speaking</a>, China is one of the safest countries in the world for solo female travellers. I have travelled through pretty much every province in China solo and I’ve never had any problems. That being said, accidents and crime can happen anywhere! So, it’s important to be vigilant and take precautions like you would when traveling anywhere in the world.
              </p>
              <p>I’ve had some of my best experiences when traveling solo in China. Traveling solo means you are forced to make deep connections with the local people in the places you travel through - because if you don’t connect with them, you’ll be extremely lonely for most of your journey!</p>

              <p>As a feminist, I find it depressing that no matter where women go, we are judged on our bodies and must conform to societal norms so not to garner the ‘wrong sort of attention’. But this is the world we live in and therefore it’s a topic that needs to be addressed. Contrary to popular belief, China is quite liberal when it comes to gender equality and I’ve had a much easier time traveling in China as a woman than most European and North American countries. In major cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong you can wear pretty much anything you want. However, there are some areas which you should ensure you are more conservatively dressed than others. The West is typically much more conservative than the East and I would strongly recommend covering up if you travel to minority areas like Tibet, Inner Mongolia, or Xinjiang.</p>

                title="So, what should I wear?"
              />
              <p>As a woman travelling on your own, it’s a good idea to follow local fashion customs. There are some cultural differences that exist between China and the West as to what is considered appropriate clothing. For example, in many Western countries it is quite common for women to wear low cut shirts that show some cleavage whereas very short shorts are considered inappropriate. In China, it’s the opposite. I’ve seen many young Chinese women wearing exceedingly short shirts and skirts, but cleavage is never exposed, and shoulders are usually covered.</p>
              <p>If you are traveling in minority areas or to sacred sites, I would strongly advise dressing conservatively. Minority groups are typically much more conservative than the Han Chinese majority. In my personal experience, they also greatly appreciate any kind of conformity with their values as it is considered as a sign of respect. It also shows an understanding and respect of cultures that, in many cases, are fighting for survival. For example, when I was in Tuyok village in Xinjiang, an important pilgrimage site for Uyghur Muslims, I wore a scarf over my hair, long loose trousers and a loose-fitting T-shirt. A group of local women were so happy (and surprised) to see a foreigner trying to wear a headscarf that I was pulled into a local house, offered tea, and was gifted an authentic Uyghur headscarf and taught how to tie it properly.</p>

                title="Unwanted attention"
              />
              <p>When in China, you will get stared at... a lot! But this is more because people are curious when they see a foreigner - especially a woman - travelling alone. As a foreigner, you will attract a lot of attention. People are generally curious as to where you’re from, why you’re in China and if you’re enjoying yourself. People will likely take pictures of you, take selfies with you, and ask to be your friend on social media. However, this is not an issue based on gender. Both foreign men and women will attract a lot of attention in China. Usually, the attention is benign and based on curiosity. Keep in mind that there are still many people in China (particularly in rural areas) who have never seen or met a real foreigner before. This is why a lot of people get extremely excited when they encounter a foreigner – I should add that this is especially true for women of colour!</p>

                title="Are sleeper trains and overnight busses safe for women?"
              />
              <p>Sleeper trains and overnight busses are safe for solo female travellers in China. I have never had a problem on overnight or long-haul transport while traveling solo in China. I did have one young man stare at me like I was an alien from Mars for about 4 hours straight while taking a sleeper train from Beijing to Xi’an in hard sleeper class. Although extremely off-putting, he never intimidated me or approached me.</p>

                title="Scams and petty theft"
              />
              <p>Scammers and pickpockets do exist but do not single out solo women; you’ll only be pickpocketed if you make it easy for them! Scams and petty theft are not gender related issues. They aren’t that common anymore, but it always pays to be vigilant - regardless of your gender!</p>
              <a-page-header
                style="border: 1px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
                title="Violent gender-based crimes"
              />
              <p>Violent crime is very rare in China. China is a very proud, rigid and authoritarian country. If something happened to foreigner while traveling in China, it would be considered a national humiliation. The perpetrator would also be severely punished. The Chinese penal code and criminal justice system is severe which hugely discourages violent crime, especially against foreigners. However, although extremely unlikely, violent crime can happen anywhere in the world and it is important to be vigilant no matter where you travel.</p>

                title="What is the biggest risk when travelling in China?"
              />
              <p>The biggest risk when traveling in China is probably traffic accidents. However, this applies equally to both men and women. Traffic is much busier than in the west and cars tend to be much more aggressive. Be vigilant when crossing the road and make sure you look both ways!</p>
